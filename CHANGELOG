2012.08.27 - OpenDLP 0.5.1
- Fixed some input validation issues in start-verify.html. These were introduced
  in 0.5 and primarily affected Windows share scans.
- Reverted Windows agent to 0.4.4 version as the 0.5 version was crashing.
- Changed profiles.html for Metasploit-based scans to not display the OS
  username and password HTML fields. These fields are not required and not used
  for Metasploit-based scans anyway.
- Made small changes to help.html.

2012.07.25 - OpenDLP 0.5
- Added support for launching agents over Meterpreter sessions
  (charles.smith@n2netsec.com, michael.baucom@n2netsec.com)
- Cleaned up Windows agent code (charles.smith@n2netsec.com)

2012.02.22 - OpenDLP 0.4.4
- Fixed issue #43: "Not able to scan MSSQL 2005 DB"
- Fixed issue #46: "MS SQL Scan with instance"
- Fixed issue #47: "Agent crashes with many files"
- Improved memory use for UNIX agentless filesystem scans
- Improved memory use for Windows agentless filesystem and share scans
- Added overall totals to viewresults.html for each scan type
- Fixed aesthetic bug when launching agentless scans and no HTML newline breaks
  were printing in the "Child agentless scanning process started" message.
- Added more notes about MSSQL instances to startscan.html page.
- Added message in profile creation page's agent installation path about temp
  files possibly being readable by other users.
- Escaped a backslash in help.html.

2012.01.07 - OpenDLP 0.4.3
- Fixed bugs related to not accounting for whitespaces in profile or scan names.
  This would cause scan results and logs to not properly display in web UI.
- Fixed bug that didn't allow all legal characters in Microsoft Windows share
  names. This prevented users from running agentless Windows share scans against
  systems like "\\192.168.1.1\@share". OpenDLP previously only allowed nothing
  but alphanumeric, underscore, dash, and period characters.

2011.09.08 - OpenDLP 0.4.2
- Fixed bug when ZIP files contained same file name (case insensitive). This
  would cause the unzip.exe to prompt whether to overwrite, skip, or rename,
  which would make OpenDLP stall indefinitely. This is now fixed to ignore
  files with the same case-insensitive name after the first has already been
  extracted. This only affected Windows agent scans.
- Added lots of client-side Javascript input validation to the profile page.

2011.08.15 - OpenDLP 0.4.1
- Agent: Fixed crashing bug when trying to scan files greater than 2 GB. Big
  thanks to JRS for the research and patch!
- Agent: If results are uploaded after only first file was done being scanned,
  agent would report 0 bytes scanned. Now it reports size of that first file to
  the webapp.
- Webapp: Fixed typo bug causing Windows agentless/share scans not to work with
  pass-the-hash
- Webapp: Fixed issue with pass-the-hash not working for agent scans

- Agent: Fixed significant crashing bug from trying to write a NULL beyond the
  end of allocated memory.

  greater than the size allowed by the agent to use in RAM.
- Webapp: Fixed bug that would still print false positives in XML output
- Added another level of logging verbosity.

  directory had leftover subdirectories.

  buttons to not function on the two higher level viewresults.html pages.
- Webapp: Cleaned up other minor bugs related to database calls.
- Agent: Removed ability for agent to scan floppy drives. On some Windows 2000
  systems, a dialog displays on the screen warning the user that there is no
  floppy in the drive. The scan would not proceed until this dialog was
  addressed.

2011.02.05 - OpenDLP 0.2.6
- Webapp: Added pass-the-hash support thanks to a patch supplied by @steponequit
  ("someLuser" at blog.hurricanelabs.com and console-cowboys.blogspot.com).

- Fixed bug 9: Added support for underscores in Windows domain names.
- Speed enhancement: If user selects to only scan specified directories,
  OpenDLP no longer enumerates all files on all drives when it initializes. It
  will only enumerate files in specified directories.

2010.05.24 - OpenDLP 0.2.2
- Fixed bug where Windows agent would crash if it was unable to open the very
  last file inside a ZIP archive.
- Fixed bug where Windows agent would crash if it attempted to process an
  empty ZIP file.
- Fixed bug where Windows agent would stall if it attempted to process a
  password-protected ZIP file.
- Fixed bug where Windows agent would not fully delete remnants of ZIP files
  if some files were marked as read-only, which would cause web application's
  uninstallation process to not fully delete entire installation directory.

  "Upload URL" resides.
